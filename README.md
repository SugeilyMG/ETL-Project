# ETL-Project

#################

This is a project in which its main focus is to apply the ETL Process (Extract- Transformation- Load) onto a dataset. 

#################
Extract:
	For this step keggle.com was used. The topics that were searched were US Politics and Social Media, more precisely, 2020 US Presidential Elections and how the Social Media was affected.
	
#################
Transformation:
	Jupyter Notebook: The transformation of the datasets was made using a Jupyter Notebook with the Pandas Library, using methods of unifying datasets by common column names. Functions such as loc, groupby, drop, rename and merge, were used to properly create links between the datasets with Python language.
	Jupyter Notebook: The final step was to transform all of the resulting datasets into CSV format.

#################
Load:
	Postgres: For this second part of the transformation Postgres was used. Having the desired CSV formats previously created in the Jupyter Notebook.
	Postgres: Also in Postgres, SQL language was used to make the final merges of the datasets, and get a final and unified dataset.
